Kids enjoyed games underone roof like table tennis, badminton,football, carrom, dart game4. The pool was amazingly clean with floaters and under the observation of one staff member for cleanliness and safety5. Restaurant is just besides the pool and the food preparation is hygenic and food tastes yummy6.
